      <h1>Modern, balanced beer from Berlin</h1>
      <p>We are a Berlin based gypsy brewer duo: Georg and Lukasz. Before going our own path,
      we travelled the world to learn more about brewing from some of the best breweries out there.
      We draw inspiration from our favorite New England and German brewing styles and mix that
      with our experience from apprenticing at <strong>PÃµhjala</strong>, <strong>Beavertown</strong>,
      <strong>Half Acre Beer Company</strong> and <strong>Boneyard Beer</strong>.</p>
